Aide-De-Camp is a backend agnostic delayed job queue. Very similar to [`girl_friday`](https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday) from the Ruby world.

Notable features:

- **Asynchronous**. Built from the ground-up using async/await for maximum concurrency.
- **Backend agnostic**[^1]. This crate won't force you to run any additional software you don't want to.
- **Flexible scheduling**. Schedule your job to run right now, in time relative to now or at a specific future time.
- **Binary Payloads**. Job payloads serialized with bincode for maximum speed and space efficiency.
- **Concurrency limits.** Specify desired concurrency for each runner.
- **Job Router**. Run as many job types as you want and limit which runners can process which jobs.
- **Cross Platform**. Runs anywhere rust has standard lib.
- **Traced**. All important functions are [instrumented](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing).

## Getting started

### Install

Pick a backend[^1] that suits you and add following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
aide-de-camp = "0.2.0"
aide-de-camp-sqlite = "0.2.0"  # Or any other available backend
```

### Usage

`aide-de-camp-sqlite` has a pretty detailed example of how to use this crate.

## Components

- **core**. Traits and error types meant to be used by aide-de-camp ecosystem.
- **runner**. Optional module (`runner` feature enabled by default) that contains default implementations of runner, job router and types required for their work.

[^1]: Currently, only SQLite supported (`aide-de-camp-sqlite`), but PostgreSQL backend is coming soon!
